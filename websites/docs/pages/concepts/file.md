# File

Files are how you keep track of text you want to pass to a Language Models. It is different from an instruction in that
it only contains data. This could be anything from a user question, a short story, a recipe or a research paper.

You can use your files to test your [instructions](instructions.md) or as part of a [tool](tools.md).
