Here is a summary of the different features of Prompt Studio:

### **Instructions with Batteries Included**

Don't worry about context length, we can run instructions optimized for different use cases, from document analysis to summarization, we provide you with the tools you need out of the box. If you want total control, you can still build your own custom instructions.

### **Shareable Previews**

Turn your AI [recipes](recipe.md) into shareable [previews](preview.md) for your colleagues.

### **API Deployments**

Prompt Studio is a fully-managed LLM backend that allows you to deploy your AI recipes in an instant. We'll take care of infrastructure, scaling and maintenance for you.

### Extra Notes

LLMs excel in tasks such as information extraction, text classification, summarization, text generation, etc. The possibilities are endless, and the quality of the results you get from LLMs will be determined by the quality of your instructions. That's why we're soon adding what we call our "Promptly", which is a sort of Grammarly for prompts to help you craft better instructions to the LLM.

With Prompt Studio, we are fully decoupling prompt engineering and AI development from software development and we are adding new features quite often to support you in your AI development journey.
