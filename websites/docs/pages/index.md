## Overview of functionalities in Prompt Studio

In Prompt Studio, you can start by creating your first [**recipe**](concepts/recipe.md) which would be a collection of AI instructions.

- Does your AI solution involve multiple steps? Chain your AI [**instructions**](concepts/instructions.md#chained-instructions-in-a-recipe) by simply referring with `/ to the output of the previous instruction. 

- Do you need to enrich the AI instruction with contextual data from [**files**](concepts/file.md)? Type "/", define your context name and upload your file. This will include the content of the file within the instruction and give more context to guide the LLM for better output.

- Do you want to share your AI solution with your colleagues or customers? Simply click on [**preview**](concepts/preview.md) to generate a user interface that you can share with your colleagues. 

- Does your engineering team need to integrate this AI solution with an application or your internal systems? Click on "API" and deploy your solution. This makes it available through Prompt Studio's API.

- We know that testing your AI instructions is an integral part of AI development, that's why we have the [**scenarios**](concepts/scenarios.md) page, where you can run your instructions across a large batch of inputs to test how your recipe performs in different scenarios.
