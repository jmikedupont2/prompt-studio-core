# Welcome to the Prompt Studio docs!

Prompt Studio is a collaborative prompt engineering platform for teams that work with LLMs. With Prompt Studio you can bridge the gap between domain experts and engineers building LLM-powered features.

Software engineers are crucial for the integration of LLM powered features into a software product but domain experts are just as important. You need the entire team involved in prompt engineering and QA.
